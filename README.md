<p>One of the biggest problems faced by startups is the difficulty of being able to explain their business ideas, products and services to their customers, simply and as quickly as possible. One of the effects of technology is that the attention span of the average person is shorter now than ever and the quicker someone can convey the information the better. Unfortunately, a few words cannot articulate a concept, and there is the possibility of losing audience's attention and losing a customer. Business owners, therefore, need a means of Grabbing the Attention of their target audience and delivering their message in a few seconds as possible.</p>
